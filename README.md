## Classes and Inheritance

### Concepts Used:
- **ES6 Classes:** Define classes for `Workout`, `Running`, and `Cycling`.
- **Inheritance:** inheritance used to extend the `Workout` class for specific workout types (`Running` and `Cycling`).

## Private Class Fields

### Concepts Used:
- **Private Fields:** Use the `#` syntax to define private fields within classes to encapsulate data.

## Geolocation API

### Concepts Used:
- **Geolocation API:** Access the user's current position to load the map at their location.

## Leaflet Library

### Concepts Used:
- **Leaflet Maps:** Integrate Leaflet to display an interactive map.
- **Map Markers and Popups:** Add markers and popups to the map to represent workouts.

## Local Storage

### Concepts Used:
- **Local Storage API:** Store and retrieve workouts from local storage to persist data across sessions.

## Event Handling

### Concepts Used:
- **Event Listeners:** Attach events to handle user interactions, such as form submissions, map clicks, and workout clicks.
- **Event Delegation:** Use event delegation to manage events efficiently.

## Form Validation and Handling

### Concepts Used:
- **Form Handling:** Manage form visibility, input fields, and form submissions.
- **Input Validation:** Validate form inputs to ensure data integrity.
